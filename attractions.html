    <h1>Vacation Attractions</h1><hr>
    <p>After ariving at Orlando, Papyrus and I decided to take Paul for a walk and we met up with Steven and the Nameless King.</p>

    <p>After seeing Steven and the Nameless King, we all wanted to go somewhere as a group, so we went over to the nearest free attraction that we could find. About 20 miles away was the USTA National Campus. We played tennis and it was SUPER cool!!!</p>

    <p>Next up we went to Universal for $120 each and it was SUPER AWESOME!!!!! Papyrus and I even got to do a meet and greet with Stampy Long Nose: the latest property of the parks company! We also noticed I couldn't see and realized that we lost Paul. Where is Paul, we need to find Paul, help me find Paul, what happened to Paul.</p>

    <p>The Nameless King seemed like a nice guy, but I saw an evil glint in his eyes. Papyrus and I decided that it would be best to find Steven and Nameless King and follow them to the next place they went: Disney World, for $125 each. This was not a planned destination, and the cost of general nessecities there felt almost unhealthy, but we needed to find Paul. I couldn't see without my seeing eye dog. When we made it to Disney we sadly couldn't find Steven or Nameless King anywhere.</p>

    <p>After no success in finding paul, we stumbled our way down to the beach and cried. Paul could've been kidnapped, dead, or worse. At this point in time, I had developed a severe case of Emo Syndrome, and I wore the most dead-inside clothing that I had. Luckily, Papyrus: being innocent and naive, enjoyed his time at the beach.</p>

    <p>Overall, this trip felt unsuccessful. I came here to have a good time, but instead I lost Paul, blew all of my money on a capitalist mouse, and was impaled by the springs in my probably $15 bed. The plane ride home was sad. I missed Paul, and Papyrus was still oblivious as to what was even going on. He doesn't even know who I am, I just carried him here in a bag. Taking this bonehead on a trip here practically ruined my life, I blame everything on him. I even had to ride home on the wing of the plane because he pushed me out as a "funny prank" to go on his CoolSkeleton95 Youtube channel, I could've bought his Youtube channel with the money I was given. Without any <a href = "https://motivational-quotes-trevorfurtado.classof2025.repl.co" class = "text">motivation</a> or will to live I don't know what to do with my life. Curse you Papyrus, curse you Nameless King, and curse you Steven Barnes.</p>
