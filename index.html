    <h1>My Awesome and/or Silly Vacation to Orlando Florida</h1>

    <p>I recieved $2,000 from my teacher for my april vacation, I went to Orlando Florida with my good ol' pal Papyrus, and my support dog: Paul! Papyrus was a little nervous, as he hadn't ever been to another state before. Past leaving Mount Ebott back in 201X, he hadn't really ever left his home. This was precisely why I decided to take him on this trip! Most people that he knew lived around him, and he was content. Papyrus, Paul, and I traveled to Florida on April 16th at 10:35 AM using a roundtrip from Delta Airlines for $520 per passenger. We stayed at the Grand Orlando Resort at 2900 Parkway Blvd, Kissimmee. This hotel wasn't the greatest, but we stayed there to stay on budget and be close to popular attractions.</p>
